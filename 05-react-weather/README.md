# React Weather App

This is a simple weather application built with React and Vite. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on user input.

## Get Started

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add your OpenWeatherMap API key.
2. Install the dependencies:

   ```zsh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:

   ```zsh
    npm run dev
    ```
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to see the app in action.
5. Enter a city name in the input field and click the "Get Weather" button to fetch the weather data.
6. The weather data will be displayed below the input field, including the city name, temperature, humidity, and weather description.
7. You can also see the weather icon corresponding to the current weather condition.
